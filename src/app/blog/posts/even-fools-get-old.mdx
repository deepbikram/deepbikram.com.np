## I Came Across This Quote—And Here's My Thought

It hit me.  
Hard.  
Because it goes against everything we’re taught growing up.

We’re told: **"Respect your elders."**  
And yes, I do.  
But should I trust their advice automatically, just because they’re older?

Not always.

## Age ≠ Wisdom

Some people confuse experience with wisdom. But experience doesn’t mean much if it isn’t reflected on.  
You can live a long life and still never question your beliefs.  
You can grow older and grow more rigid, not more open.

> “Time doesn’t make people wise. Reflection does.”

Think about it—**even fools get old.**  
If someone has never adapted, never listened, never grown… does their age really give their advice more weight?

## What I’ve Learned

I’ve started to look at advice differently:
- Is it rooted in curiosity or control?
- Is it relevant now, or stuck in a different era?
- Is it based on personal truth—or just fear masked as wisdom?

I’ll listen to anyone.  
But I’ll only follow the advice that survives scrutiny.

## Final Thought

Respect people for who they are.  
Not just how old they are.  
Don’t dismiss advice from the young.  
And don’t blindly follow advice from the old.

Wisdom isn’t in the years.  
It’s in the learning.
