## Introduction

It's 2025. Everyone's online, everyone's scrolling, and everyone seems a little... empty.  
And yet, here I am—building technology for the future, *without* being on social media.

It's not rebellion. It's not nostalgia.  
It's survival.

## I Left Because My Mind Wasn't Mine Anymore

Every time I logged into a platform, I felt a tiny fracture in focus. My thoughts weren't original—they were reactive. My emotions weren't mine—they were hijacked.

> "Social media isn't about connection. It's about *containment*—your attention, your emotion, your identity."

The algorithm didn't just know what I liked. It shaped what I would like next.  
That's not discovery. That's design—*on you*.

## The Myth of Missing Out

People say, "But you'll miss out!"  
What exactly am I missing?

- Filtered versions of reality?
- Arguments between strangers?
- The dopamine crash after 90 minutes of scrolling and still feeling empty?

What I *found* instead was silence, depth, and real thinking.

## Attention Is a Currency—and I'm Broke Without It

We treat attention like it's infinite. It's not. It's fuel. It's power. And social media burns it like a cheap resource.

When I left, I didn't just gain time.  
I gained:

- Original thoughts  
- Better sleep  
- Deeper conversations  
- A brain that felt like *mine* again

I stopped being a node in someone else's server farm. I started becoming *human* again.

## But Don't You Build Technology?

Yes. But not the kind that robs your agency. I'm building tools like **OverlayAI** and **FocusForge**—apps that support your mind, not steal it.

Imagine a screen that helps you *leave the screen*. A personal assistant that doesn't feed you noise, but protects your signal.

> "We need technology that acts like a mirror, not a megaphone."

## A Future Beyond the Feed

I'm not anti-technology.  
I'm anti-exploitation.

We don't need to go off-grid.  
We need to go **on-purpose**.

What if the next evolution of digital life isn't about being *everywhere*—but being *present* where it counts?

## Conclusion

I'm not on social media because I want to build things that matter, think thoughts that are mine, and live a life that feels *real*.

And maybe, just maybe, the future belongs to those who can unplug—because only they will still know how to listen.
